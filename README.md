# SCP-ARG

SCP-ARG has a full crud that leads to an index page where one can add information and post it back into the index page. With a show route and a delete route. In order to enter the website you need a log-in and sign up thorugh controller folders. Entering incorrect information will result in a res-send and lead back to the "/" page, which acts as an intro.
